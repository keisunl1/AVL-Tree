# AVL-Tree
This project is an experimentation on my usage of the AVL tree data structure. 

MyAVLTree.hpp aims to be able to create AVL trees of any size, and follows the conditionality of an AVL tree's reshaping when values are put in.
The AVL trees in the .hpp file are created from the program itself - no external libraries or files are required in order to make the AVL tree.
